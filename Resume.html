As the database design changed rapidly, I worked with the DBA to build code generation scripts with CodeSmith Generator to create the data access code from the Oracle database. I then worked with and trained other developers to utilize the data access layer in the business layer as we built out the application. I was also involved with research and development of new Ajax technologies that were just then coming into their own for building more efficient web based interfaces.</li>
